        <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>

                Randy has a busy work schedule and is generally pressed for time. He looks at multiple work portfolios
                a day trying to fill positions. He looks for someone that stands out and is organized with their resume and
                portfolio. He uses a hiring website for some candidates but loves to search Dice.com and LinkedIn for potential
                employees.
            </p>
        <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
            <p>
                Randy is looking to hire for 3 positions. All of these are entry level positions. The company needs someone
                proficient with Github and who works well in a team setting. Because most projects are built by a team of
                developers, the right chemistry is vital for success. The company offers a mid-range salary but has
                great 401k match and other benefits. Techdesign.com is needing to hire people as soon as possible to keep
                up with their customers' needs.
            </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Randy needs to hire multiple people who require minimal training. Since Randy has many portfolios to review,
                he spends the majority of his time looking for the specific technical and interpersonal skills that meet
                his hiring requirements. The job listing was recently posted and has had multiple applicants. Randy needs
                to narrow candidates as quickly as possible.
            </p>
        <h3>User Story</h3>
            <p>
                As a hiring manager, it is essential to identify the best candidates for permanent full stack positions
                in a timely manner.
